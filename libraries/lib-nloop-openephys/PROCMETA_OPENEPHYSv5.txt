Processor node metadata from Open Ephys v5 is saved as structures (one per
processor node), derived from the "processor" tag parse trees returned by
readstruct(). These metadata structures have the following fields:


Common to all processor node types:


"rawconfig" is the raw XML parse tree for the processor node, as returned
  by "readstruct()".

"procname" is a character vector containing the "pluginName" attribute.
"proclib" is a character vector containing the "libraryName" attribute.
"procnode" is a number containing the "NodeId" attribute.

"channelselect" is a logical vector containing the channel selection state's
  "param" attribute values from all "channel" tags in the processor node.
  This may be an empty vector for special nodes like splitters.
  Note that the "number" attribute starts counting at 0, so the index in
  "channelselect" is equal to "number" + 1.

"descsummary" is a cell array of character vectors containing a
  human-readable short summary of the node configuration. This may be {}.
"descdetailed" is a cell array of character vectors containing a
  human-readable detailed description of the node configuration. This
  may be {}.



For nodes with plugin name 'Intan Rec. Controller':


"samprate" is the sampling rate used by the recording controller, in Hz.
"bandpass" [ low high ] describes the corner frequencies of the headstage
  band-pass filters connected to the controller.
"chanlabels" is a cell array containing the names of the channels
  exported by the recording controller (in Open Ephys's order).



For nodes with plugin name 'Channel Map':


"chanmap" is a structure containing a channel map, per OPENEPHYS_CHANMAP.txt.



For nodes with plugin name 'Record Node':


"writefolder" is a character vector storing the folder path to save to.
"wantevents" is true if events are to be saved, false otherwise.
"wantspikes" is true if spikes are to be saved, false otherwise.
"savedchans" is a logical vector indicating whether each channel is to be
  saved (FIXME: out of those accepted by channelselect?).



Unrecognized plugin names will still return the "common to all types"
metadata, which includes the full parse tree, facilitating user processing
of unrecognized configuration information.
