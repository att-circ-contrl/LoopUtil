A batched iteration processing function handle is called to perform signal
processing when iterating across a very large FT dataset in batches of
channels or batches of trials (to avoid loading the entire dataset into
memory).

The intention is to abstract away the channel and trial batching logic.

A batched iteration processing function has the form:

[ ftdata_new auxdata ] = ...
  iterfunc_batched( ftdata_old, chanindices_orig, trialindices_orig )

"ftdata_old" is a "ft_datatype_raw" structure containing this batch's data.
"chanindices_orig" is a vector with one entry per channel in ftdata_old
  containing each channel's corresponding index in the larger dataset
  (prior to batching).
"trialindices_orig" is a vector with one entry per trial in ftdata_old
  containing each trial's corresponding index in the larger dataset
  (prior to batching).

"ftdata_new" is a modified version of ftdata_old (after any iterator
  data processing is performed), or struct([]) to omit consturction.
"auxdata" is a cell array indexed by {trial, channel} containing arbitrary
  user-defined data that the user wishes to associate with each trial/channel.


A typical batched iteration processing function definition would be as
follows. This example wraps a helper function that is passed additional
arguments set at the time the processing function is defined, and also
wraps nlFT_iterateAcrossData() for per-trial/per-channel processing.


tuning_parameters = (stuff);
other_parameters = (stuff);
processing_config = (stuff);

iterfunc_batched = @( ftdata_old, chanindices_orig, trialindices_orig ) = ...
  helper_do_batch_iteration( ftdata_old, ...
    chanindices_orig, trialindices_orig ...
    processing_config, tuning_parameters, other_parameters );


function [ ftdata_new auxdata ] = helper_do_batch_iteration( ...
  ftdata_old, chanindices_orig, trialindices_orig, ...
  proc_config, tuning_params, other_params )

  ftdata_new = ft_preprocessing(proc_config, ftdata_old);

  iterfunc_single = @( wavedata, timedata, samprate, ...
    trialidx, chanidx, chanlabel ) ...
    helper_do_channel_iteration( wavedata, timedata, samprate, ...
      trialidx, chanidx, chanlabel, chanindices_orig, trialindices_orig, ...
      tuning_params, other_params );

  [ newtrials auxdata ] = ...
    nlFT_iterateAcrossData( ftdata_new, iterfunc_single );
  ftdata_new.trial = newtrials;

end
