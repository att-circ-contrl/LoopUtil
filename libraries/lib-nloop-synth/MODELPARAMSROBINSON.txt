Sigmoid parameters (common to all):

"qmax" is the maximum firing rate (1/sec); typically 250.
"threshlevel" is the average neuronal threshold (mV); typically 15.
"threshsigma" is the standard deviation of the neuronal threshold (mV);
  typically 6.0.


Neural dynamics parameters (common to all):

"alpha" is the inverse decay time (1/sec); typically 50.
"beta" is the inverse rise time (1/sec); typically 200.
"gamma" is the inverse within-cortex propagation time (1/sec); typically 100.


Cortico-thalamic circuit parameters (FIXME - Function):

"halfdelay" is half of the round-trip cortex/thalamus loop time (ms). Typ. 40.
