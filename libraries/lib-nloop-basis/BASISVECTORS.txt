The "nlBasis_getBasisVectors_XX" functions decompose a set of input signals
into weighted sums of a set of basis vectors, plus a common background.


Input signals are stored as is a Nvectors x Ntimesamples matrix of sample
vectors. For ephys data, this is typically Nchans x Ntimesamples.


A basis decomposition is stored as a structure with the following fields:

"basisvecs" is a Nbasis x Ntimesamples matrix where each row is a basis
  vector.
"coeffs" is a Nvectors x Nbasis matrix with basis vector weights for each
  input vector.
"background" is a 1 x Ntimesamples vector containing a constant background
  to be added to all vectors during reconstruction. This is typically, but
  not always, either zero or the mean across sample vectors.


The input is reconstructed as:

recon = coeffs * basisvecs + repmat( background, Nvectors, 1 );
