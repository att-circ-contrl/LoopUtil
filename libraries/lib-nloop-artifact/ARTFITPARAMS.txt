An artifact curve fit parameter structure describes a curve fit performed
by one of the nlArt_fitXX functions.


Fields common to all types:

"fittype" is a character vector indicating the curve fit model used.
  'exp' is a first-order exponential decay fit.



First-order exponential decay fit:

This has the form:   f(t) = coeff * exp(t/tau) + offset

"fittype" is 'exp'.
Parameter fields are:  "coeff", "tau", "offset"
