Exponential fits with guessed locations are configured using a structure with
the following fields:

"max_curves" is the number of components to curve fit.

"fitmethod" is a character vector specifying the curve fit algorithm used.
  This is 'log' or 'pinmax', per nlArt_fitExpDecay().

"want_pin_minimum" is true to perform one additional 'pinmax' curve fit at
  the "min_fit_offset_ms" time, and false otherwise.

"lowpass_corner" is the corner frequency in Hz of the low-pass filter
  to apply before performing curve fits, or NaN to not filter.

"lowpass_squash_ms" [ start stop ] is a time range to squash before
  performing low-pass filtering, in milliseconds. This is intended to
  suppress ringing from artifacts. Set this to [] to not squash.

"full_time_range_ms" is the time range over which curve fitting is to be
  performed, in milliseconds.

"min_fit_offset_ms" is the minimum offset relative to the start of
  full_time_range_ms at which fits are to be performed. The intent is to
  avoid ill-behaved regions at the exact time of stimulation.

"post_level_span" [ min max ] is the fraction of the time range to use for
  estimating the after-setting DC level (e.g. [ 0.5 0.9 ]).

"from_detect_level_span" [ min max ] is the time range to use for updating
  the DC level estimate after curve fitting, as a multiple of the
  excursion detection time within the full time range (e.g. [ 1.0 2.0 ] ).

"detect_threshold" is the amount by which the signal must depart from the
  DC level for an artifact to be considered present. This is a multiple
  of the median-to-quartile distance (about two thirds of a standard
  deviation). Typical values are 6-12 for clear exponential excursions.

"fit_range" [ min max ] is a multiplier to apply to the excursion detection
  time to get the time range over which to curve fit (e.g. [ 0.7 3.0 ]).

"next_mult" is a multiplier to apply to the excursion detection time to get
  the maximum acceptable detection time for the next excursion (e.g. 0.9).
  This is to prevent the algorithm from continually re-fitting the same
  span (which it can do if it's having trouble getting a good curve fit).

"detect_max_start" is a relative position within the full time range
  (e.g. 0.3). Excursions detected after this time are assumed to be
  spurious (wandering DC level).

"min_detect_ms" is the minimum time after the beginning of the time range
  when an artifact excursion may be detected. Excursions before this time
  (i.e. very short excursions) are assumed to be spurious. In practice
  these either have strange shapes (hard to fit) or are excursions
  introduced by previous curve fits.

"min_first_detect_ms" is the minimum time after the beginning of the time
  range when the first artifact excursion may be detected. If the first
  attempt at detecting excursions finds an artifact before this time, the
  attempt is abandoned. This happens when the threshold is set too high and
  the tail of the exponential isn't detected.
