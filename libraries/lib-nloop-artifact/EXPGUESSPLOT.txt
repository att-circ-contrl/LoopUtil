Exponential fit debug plots are configured using a structure with the
following fields:


"fileprefix" is a prefix to use when building plot and report filenames.

"titleprefix" is a plot-safe human-readable prefix to use when building
  plot titles.

"plot_sizes_ms" is a cell array containing [ min max ] time ranges
  in milliseconds for which plots are to be generated.

"plot_labels" is a cell array containing filename- and plot-safe
  character vectors associated with each of the plotting time ranges.

"time_squash_ms" [ min max ] is a time range to set NaN when plotting
  (so that artifacts don't perturb the Y axis range), or [] to not squash.



Additional fields for nlFT_guessMultipleExpDecays:


"max_trial_count" is the maximum number of trials for which debug plots
  are to be generated.

"max_chan_count" is the maximum number of channels for which debug plots
  are to be generated.
