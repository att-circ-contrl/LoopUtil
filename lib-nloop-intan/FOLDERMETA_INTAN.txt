Intan-specific folder metadata format is as follows. This is intended as a
reference for maintaining code; nothing outside of this set of functions
should need to look at Intan-specific metadata.

The sole exception is knowing what to look for in the "devicetype" field.



In "folder metadata":

- "devicetype" is "intanrec" or "intanstim".
- "nativemeta" is the output of nlIntan_readMetadata().
- Banks are named "ampA".."ampH", "auxA".."auxH", "Ain", "Din", and "Dout".

NOTE - Analog output from the controller does not seem to be saved.



In "signal bank metadata":

- "banktype" is "ttl" for "Din" and "Dout" and "analog" for other banks.
- "handle" is a structure with the following fields:

  - "format" is "onefileperchan", "neuroscope", or "monolithic".

  For "onefileperchan":
  - "chanfilechans" is a vector containing channel indices in the same order
    as "chanfilenames".
  - "chanfilenames" is a vector containing channel data filenames in the
    same order as 'chanfilechans".
  - "timefile" is the file to read sample indices from.

  FIXME - "neuroscope" and "monolithic" NYI.



This is the end of the file.
