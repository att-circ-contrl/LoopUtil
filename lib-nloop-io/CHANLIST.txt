Channel lists are used for several purposes. They may be used to specify a
set of channels, or they may be used to store per-channel information such
as reference selection or physical source channel in a channel map.



A "project-level channel list" is a structure with one field per folder,
indexed by user-assigned folder label. Each folder's field contains a
"folder-level channel list".



A "folder-level channel list" is a structure with one field per bank, indexed
by bank label. Each bank's field contains a "bank-level channel list".



A "bank-level channel list" is a structure with the following fields:

- "chanlist" is a vector containing integer-valued channel indices.

For reference selection:
- "reflabel" is a character array containing the user-specified name of the
  reference to use, when re-referencing. An empty name means "don't
  re-reference".
  (References are typically defined as channel lists stored elsewhere.)

For channel mapping:
- "foldersrc" is a cell array containing the folder labels of the source
  channels for each channel in "chanlist".
- "banksrc" is a cell array containing the bank labels of the source
  channels for each channel in "chanlist".
- "chansrc" is a vector containing channel indices of the source channels
  for each channel in "chanlist".



This is the end of the file.
