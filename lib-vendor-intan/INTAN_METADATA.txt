An Intan metadata structure is a structure containing header information
supplied by RHD and RHS files, in a format consistent with that provided by
"read_Intan_RHD2000_file.m" and "read_Intan_RHS2000_file.m".

The metadata structure has the following fields:

"filename" is the file that was read (including path).
"path" is the folder path containing data files.
"devtype" is 'RHD' or 'RHS'.
"version_major" is the major version number of the data file.
"version_minor" is the minor version number of the data file.
"num_samples_per_data_block" is the number of samples per data block, for
  monolithic data.
"frequency_parameters" is a structure with the following fields:
  "amplifier_sample_rate" is the ephys channel sampling rate.
  "aux_input_sample_rate" is the sampling rate of the on-chip auxiliary
    analog inputs.
  "supply_voltage_sample_rate" is the sampling rate of the chip supply
    voltage measurement.
  "board_adc_sample_rate" is the sampling rate of the RHD controller's
    BNC analog inputs.
  "board_dig_in_sample_rate" is the sampling rate of the RHD controller's
    TTL inputs.
  "desired_dsp_cutoff_frequency" is the user-specified cutoff for the
    on-chip first-order digital high-pass filter.

    the ephys amplifiers. This is a first-order high-pass filter.

    bandwidth for the ephys amplifiers when recovering from stimulation.

    bandwidth for the ephys amplifiers when recovering from stimulation.
  "desired_upper_bandwidth" is the user-specified upper bandwidth for
    the ephys amplifiers. This is a third-order low-pass filter.
  "actual_upper_bandwidth" is the implemented upper bandwidth for the
    ephys amplifiers. This is a third-order low-pass filter.
  "notch_filter_frequency" is the center frequency of the power line
    frequency rejection filter, or 0 for no notch filtering. This is
    a software-implemented biquad filter.

    channels to after stimulation, if performing charge recovery.
    FIXME - Units?
  "amp_settle_mode" indicates whether fast-settling is to be performed after
    stimulation, and whether bandwidth-switched or traditional settling is
    to be used. FIXME - Encoding?
  "charge_recovery_mode" indicates whether or not charge recovery is to be
    performed after stimulation, and whether current-limited recovery or
    resistive recovery is to be used. FIXME - Encoding?
"notes" is a structure with the following fields:

"dc_amp_data_saved" is FIXME - Info goes here.
"board_mode" indicates board configuration. This mostly affects BNC
  analog input scale. Mode 0 is 50.354 uV/LSB, mode 1 is 152.59 uV/LSB,
  and mode 13 is 312.5 uV/LSB.
"reference_channel" is a character array containing the name of the
  channel used for re-referencing the input, or an empty string.
"amplifier_channels" is a structure array with zero or more entries
  containing ephys channel metadata.
"spike_triggers" is a structure array with the same number of entries
  as "amplifier_channels", containing spike scope trigger settings for
  each ephys channel.
